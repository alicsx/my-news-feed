Although the RSI is neutral and the MACD is bullish, the key resistance level at 1.31862 provides a clear stop loss point. The low volatility and low risk level support a moderate position size. Selling at the current price with a stop loss beyond key resistance and a take profit at key support provides a favorable risk-reward ratio.",
