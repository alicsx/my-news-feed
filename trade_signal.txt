PAIR: AUD/USD
TYPE: SELL_LIMIT
ENTRY: 0.66230
SL: 0.66290
TP: 0.65850
CONFIDENCE: 8
REASON: The overall 4-hour trend for AUD/USD is strongly bearish, confirmed by the HTF ADX indicating a trending market. While recent short-term indicators (price above EMAs, bullish MACD, high RSI at 67.30) suggest a bullish retracement, this momentum is pushing the price directly into a significant HTF resistance level at 0.66251. The high RSI reading indicates potential exhaustion for this short-term bounce. Fundamentally, the prevailing sentiment favors USD strength due to higher-for-longer rate expectations from the Fed and its safe-haven appeal, while AUD remains vulnerable as a risk-sensitive commodity currency, aligning with the dominant downtrend. This setup presents a classic opportunity to "sell the bounce" at a key resistance level, re-entering the primary downtrend. The entry is strategically placed just below the HTF resistance, with a tight stop loss above it, and a substantial take profit targeting the next key HTF support, offering an excellent risk-to-reward ratio. The biggest risk is an unexpected breach of the 0.66251 resistance level, which would invalidate the immediate bearish bias. However, the confluence of a strong downtrend, resistance confluence, and supportive fundamentals makes this a high-probability setup.

PAIR: NZD/USD
TYPE: SELL_LIMIT
ENTRY: 0.58730
SL: 0.58850
TP: 0.58473
CONFIDENCE: 7
REASON: The market exhibits a clear and strong DOWNTREND on the 4-hour timeframe, reinforced by a TRENDING market regime and price consistently below key moving averages. Fundamentally, global risk aversion and a relatively hawkish Fed continue to support USD strength, while NZD faces headwinds, aligning perfectly with a bearish outlook for NZD/USD. Current price action shows a retracement, with LTF MACD indicating temporary bullish momentum. This is interpreted as a counter-trend move within the dominant downtrend. Price is now approaching the critical HTF resistance at 0.58730. Our strategy is to capitalize on the likely resumption of the downtrend from this key resistance level. A SELL_LIMIT order is placed at the resistance, with a tight stop above to manage risk, and targeting the recent HTF support as the primary profit objective, anticipating the short-term bullish momentum will exhaust at resistance and the overall bearish trend will reassert itself.
