PAIR: AUD/JPY
TYPE: SELL_LIMIT
ENTRY: 97.94800
SL: 98.10000
TP: 97.23600
CONFIDENCE: 8
REASON: The overarching 4-hour trend for AUD/JPY is a clear DOWNTREND, confirmed by a strong TRENDING market regime (ADX 25.05). Fundamentally, JPY is broadly supported by ongoing speculation of a BoJ policy shift and its safe-haven appeal, while AUD faces headwinds from global growth concerns and China's economy, aligning with the bearish sentiment for this pair.

Currently, the market is experiencing a strong short-term counter-trend rally, as evidenced by price being above key LTF EMAs, bullish MACD, and a high LTF RSI (68.36), indicating potential short-term exhaustion. This rally is pushing price directly towards the significant HTF Resistance at 97.94800.

This setup presents a high-probability opportunity to fade the counter-trend rally and re-enter the prevailing downtrend at a favorable level. By placing a SELL_LIMIT order at the key resistance, we aim to capitalize on the anticipated rejection and continuation of the downtrend towards the Key Support at 97.23600. The proposed Stop Loss is placed logically above the resistance level, providing adequate buffer for potential overshoots while maintaining an attractive risk-reward profile (approx. 1:4.68). No immediate high-impact news is expected to disrupt this setup within the next 8 hours.
Expiration: 6 hours
