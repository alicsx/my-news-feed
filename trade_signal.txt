PAIR: GBP/USD
TYPE: SELL_LIMIT
ENTRY: 1.35360
SL: 1.35600
TP: 1.34880
CONFIDENCE: 8
REASON: The overarching HTF trend is a clear DOWNTREND, supported by current LTF bearish MACD momentum. Fundamentally, USD continues to find strength from hawkish Fed expectations and safe-haven flows, while GBP faces headwinds from inflation concerns and a softening economic outlook. This confluence creates a strong bearish bias. The 'unclear' HTF ADX and below-average volume suggest the market is in a consolidation phase within this downtrend. A SELL_LIMIT at the established HTF Resistance (1.35360) offers a high-probability entry to rejoin the prevailing downtrend, capitalizing on a rejection from resistance. The stop loss is placed judiciously above resistance, accounting for LTF volatility, while the take profit targets the HTF Support (1.34878), providing an excellent risk-to-reward ratio for a return to the lower boundary of the current range.

PAIR: USD/JPY
TYPE: BUY_LIMIT
ENTRY: 147.456
SL: 147.206
TP: 147.983
CONFIDENCE: 7
REASON: The High-Timeframe (4h) trend is UPTREND, strongly supported by fundamental divergence favoring USD (higher rates, strong economy) over JPY (BoJ's ultra-loose policy). However, the Market Regime (HTF ADX: 10.27) indicates the market is currently RANGING, suggesting a consolidation phase within the broader uptrend. Low-Timeframe (1h) momentum is Bearish (MACD) with RSI at 41.05, indicating a current pullback or correction. This confluence suggests the price is likely dipping towards HTF support. A BUY_LIMIT at the Key Support (147.456) aligns with the overall uptrend and the "buy the dip" strategy within a range-bound environment, anticipating a bounce off support to resume the upward movement towards resistance. The below-average volume also supports consolidation rather than a strong directional breakdown. The Stop Loss is placed sufficiently below support, and the Take Profit targets the HTF resistance, offering a favorable risk-reward ratio.

PAIR: AUD/USD
TYPE: SELL_LIMIT
ENTRY: 0.66100
SL: 0.66250
TP: 0.65500
CONFIDENCE: 8
REASON: Overwhelming technical confluence points to a strong downtrend: HTF trend is down, market regime is trending, and LTF momentum is bearish. Price is currently below key HTF resistance at 0.66168. Fundamentally, the USD maintains strength due to the Fed's "higher for longer" stance and sticky inflation, while the AUD faces headwinds from global growth concerns and potential for weaker domestic data. This robust alignment of bearish technicals with supportive fundamentals creates a high-probability opportunity to short on a retest of the resistance, aiming for a continuation of the established downtrend.

PAIR: GBP/JPY
TYPE: SELL_LIMIT
ENTRY: 199.900
SL: 200.050
TP: 199.200
CONFIDENCE: 7
REASON: HTF downtrend and LTF bearish momentum provide a directional bias within the current HTF ranging market (confirmed by low ADX and volume). Ahead of high-impact GBP/JPY news, the market is likely consolidating. A SELL_LIMIT at range resistance offers an excellent risk/reward opportunity aligned with the broader bearish trend, anticipating a move towards range support.

PAIR: AUD/JPY
TYPE: SELL_LIMIT
ENTRY: 97.722
SL: 97.880
TP: 97.236
CONFIDENCE: 8
REASON: Strong confluence of technical indicators points to a high-probability short. The pair is in a confirmed High-Timeframe DOWNTREND with a TRENDING market regime (ADX 26.30). Low-Timeframe MACD is bearish, and RSI at 41.81 indicates ample room for further downside without being oversold. Volume is normal/below average, suggesting a steady grind down rather than a reversal. A SELL_LIMIT order at the key HTF Resistance level of 97.722 provides an optimal entry for a trend continuation, offering an excellent risk-to-reward ratio. Fundamentally, assuming a neutral to slightly risk-off market sentiment or no immediate AUD-positive/JPY-negative catalysts, the underlying trend is likely to persist, favoring JPY strength and AUD weakness.

PAIR: USD/CAD
TYPE: BUY_LIMIT
ENTRY: 1.37900
SL: 1.37700
TP: 1.38450
CONFIDENCE: 8
REASON: The overarching 4-hour trend is a strong uptrend, confirmed by a trending ADX regime. Fundamentally, the USD continues to be supported by the "higher for longer" Fed narrative, while the CAD faces potential headwinds from a more dovish Bank of Canada outlook or softer oil prices, reinforcing the USD/CAD bullish bias. The current 1-hour MACD indicates a bearish momentum, suggesting a healthy pullback within this dominant uptrend. The 1-hour RSI at 58.60 confirms the pullback is not yet oversold, implying room to test support. This setup presents a high-probability "buy the dip" opportunity: we are aiming to enter near the strong HTF support level of 1.37890, expecting a bounce to resume the primary uptrend. The TP is set just below HTF resistance, offering an attractive risk-to-reward ratio.
