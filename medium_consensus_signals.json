    "ANALYSIS": "The EUR/JPY has a strong bearish trend and the RSI is at 66.0, which is considered neutral. However, the price is close to the resistance level, and a sell signal seems more likely than a buy signal. Selling at the current price with a stop loss at the resistance level and a take profit at the support level seems like a reasonable decision.",
